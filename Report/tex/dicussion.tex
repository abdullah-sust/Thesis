\section{Discussion}
One important thing to note that we know there is no any machine that perform 100\% accuracy. And we worked on users Facebook snippets with small data set and we got performance below 100\% on other algorithm like Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. So there is a lot of difference on performance between these two algorithm and Artificial Neural Network. We can not use Artificial Neural Network on this small data set. That's why we got over fit. Same case happen to Logistic Regression and Linear Regression. If we want to get better performance, we not only need large data set but also require same ratio of Religious, Sex and Age data. Otherwise, our model will be overfitted. Finally, we decide that we will use Gaussian Naive Bayes for Age, Sex and Religion classification for our small data set.
