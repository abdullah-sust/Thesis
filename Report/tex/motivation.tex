\section{Motivation}
In our first research work, we first studied to find the user personality through their social network site. Several works are done on personality measurement. Then we turn back and started to work on user classification like Gender (male/female) identification, Age and Religion classification. We have been motivated that there are more similarity on Facebook post snippets between Male and Female. And less difference between them. That's why we move forward and started working on users age, gender and religion classification through their Facebook post snippets and got better performance on some features.
