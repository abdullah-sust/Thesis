\subsection{Experiment with Logistic Regression}
As we described before linear regression is not good for our analysis, in the same time we also got similar performance for logistic regression. Because of our small amount of data set we can get a better result for logistic regression. When we applied this model, it performs with accuracy 100\% which we can say it is biased.
