\section{Linear Regression}
Linear regression is a linear approach to compute the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Linear regression is often used in predictive analysis. In linear regression, a straight line is drawn which follows the below equation  and known as hypothesis function.

\\
Here,\\
$ \X\theta $ = Denotes co-efficient matrix\\
X = Denotes the matrix of independent variables}\\
h\textsubscript{ $ \theta $}{(x)} = Denotes a hypothesis function.\\

The coefficients $\theta$ are derived using the cost function, J($\theta$) which is shown in following equation. When the cost function is minimized the values of the coefficients are considered derived.\\
\begin{center}
	\makebox J($\theta$) = $\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h\textsubscript{$\theta$}(x\textsubscript{i})-y\textsubscript{i})^{2}  $ \\
\end{center}
\\
Here, \\
m is the number of features\\
Y\textsubscript{i} is an element of output set Y = {y\textsubscript{1}, y\textsubscript{2}, y\textsubscript{3}, ... , y\textsubscript{n}} of the training data set.\\
