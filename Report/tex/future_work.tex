\begin{itemize}
	\item The data set needs to be enlarged. ANN, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression etc. algorithms performs well with large data set. 
	\item The age range of the data set is also to be enlarged. Wide range of age will help to divide the ages into age range which should perform better than just using a single age as people within certain age range performs similar activity.
	
	\item We can also consider other features for example emoticon, status timestamp, feeling of status etc.
	\item We can also focus on other social site for example LinkedIn as they are collecting many data from users.
