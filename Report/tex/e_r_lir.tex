\subsection{Experiment with Linear Regression and Result}
We applied linear regression on our data set and we got result 100\% accuracy which was inaccurate. From analysis we came to know that our analysis was not good with linear regression. The major problem was data set. The data set is so big the better this algorithm perform well. We applied linear regression for classes age, sex and religion and in every case it gave performance with 100\% accuracy. The below table shown the result of linear regression:

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Category\\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Performance\\ (\%)\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Decision\\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline
		 Age & 100\% & Overfitted \\ \hline
		 Sex & 100\% & Overfitted \\ \hline
		 Religion & 100\% & Overfitted \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
